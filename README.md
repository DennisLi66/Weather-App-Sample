# Weather App Sample
 Weather App for PM Accelerator Technical Assessment

# How to Run
1) In the highest layer of the project file directory, Add a conf.yaml file containing a single line containing a free API key from Visual-Crossing, found at https://www.visualcrossing.com/. The format should be API_KEY : (YOUR_API_KEY).
2) Use the terminal to install all node packages. (npm install)
3) Start the Electron app using the start command. (npm start)

There was a way to use an installer to have an .exe file for easy use, but unfortunately it surpassed the file size limit for Github standards.
